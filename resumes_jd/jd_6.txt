Job Title: Machine Learning Engineer (NLP/LLM Focus)
Company: LexiCore AI
Location: Remote (US-Based)
Experience Required: 4–7 years
Employment Type: Full-time

About the Role:
LexiCore AI is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in NLP and large language models to help develop next-generation language-understanding systems. You will build, deploy, and optimize models that support summarization, classification, semantic search, and generative AI use cases for enterprise customers.

You will collaborate with research scientists, data engineers, and platform teams to bring state-of-the-art LLM techniques into production environments.

Responsibilities:

Build and fine-tune NLP/LLM models for classification, summarization, and semantic similarity tasks.

Develop data pipelines for large-scale text preprocessing and labeling.

Deploy models to production using containerized microservices and CI/CD pipelines.

Monitor model performance, latency, and drift in real-time environments.

Optimize transformers for inference efficiency using quantization, pruning, and GPU acceleration.

Collaborate with research teams to evaluate new architectures and algorithms.

Partner with product teams to translate business problems into ML solutions.

Develop automated training, evaluation, and monitoring frameworks.

Document model decisions, risks, metrics, and reproducibility constraints.

Required Skills:

Strong experience with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and HuggingFace Transformers.

Expertise in NLP, LLMs, embeddings, tokenization, and prompt engineering.

Experience deploying ML models via Docker, Kubernetes, and modern CI/CD stacks.

Familiarity with distributed training and GPU-based computation.

Strong understanding of model monitoring, drift detection, and evaluation metrics.

Excellent communication and cross-team collaboration skills.

Preferred Skills:

Experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Knowledge of vector databases such as Pinecone, Milvus, or Weaviate.

Experience with cloud ML platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI).

Familiarity with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Education Requirements:
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or related fields.

Compensation Range (optional):
$150,000–$185,000 base salary

Why Join Us:

Work on cutting-edge NLP and generative AI systems.

100% remote engineering organization.

Strong emphasis on research-to-production workflows.

Competitive compensation and equity program.
